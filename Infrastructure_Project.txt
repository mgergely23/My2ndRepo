How do we develop a mobile test environment shared by all locations?
How do we design a test/replication environment which can be shared across locations & products?


What does Sales need to support mobile/existing platform?


What do you currently have:
	Mobile - Greg Hansen: Android tablet/iPads setup to demonstrate software
	Hardware becomes dated so no need to buy
	* Emulators (Deja-Click Mobile Click)
	
	What does development/qa use for unit/system testing?
	
	Rackspace?

Collab Bev (John & Rick):
	local VMWare images + Amazon hosting (up costs)
	
Tula (Alexey):
	local Hyper-V images
	some centrally available Hyper-V systems as well
	
	One note from me. Pre-sales might find the TestComplete 10 "Mobile Testing FAQ for Tier 1" useful as a reference (so that they don't have to launch mobile environments to find the answers): 

ALMComplete (Mike):
	local Oracle Virtual Box images
	Global Monitoring tool?
	Load Data/Configuration Mgt
	
Alertsite (Jeannie):
	Mobile/Wireless Provider Benchmarking
	ISP Certifications
